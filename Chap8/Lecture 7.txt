## OOP in Python

-> To map with real world scenarios, We started using objects in code.
-> This is called object oriented programming.

due to function redundancy decreace
increase reusability 

journey
Procedural -> Functional -> Object Oriented Programming


## Class & Object in Python

-> Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

#creating Class
class Student:
    name = "Karan Kumar"

#creating object (instance)
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)


## __init__ Function

Constractor 
-> All calsses have a function called __init__(),
-> Witch is always executed when the object is beaing initiated.

# creating class

class Student:
    def __init__(self,fullname):
        self.name = fullname

# creating object
s1 = Student("karan")

print(s1.name)

*The self parameter is a reference to the current
instance of the class, and is used to access variables
that belongs to the class

attributes => data;variables


## Class & Instance Attributes

Class.attr
obj.attr

## Methods

Methods are function that belong to objects

# Creating Class 
class Student:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

    def hello(self):
        print("Hello",self.name)

# Creating Object

s1 = Student("Karan")
s1.hello()
