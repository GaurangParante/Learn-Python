## OOP in Python

-> To map with real world scenarios, We started using objects in code.
-> This is called object oriented programming.

due to function redundancy decreace
increase reusability 

journey
Procedural -> Functional -> Object Oriented Programming


## Class & Object in Python

-> Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

#creating Class
class Student:
    name = "Karan Kumar"

#creating object (instance)
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)


## __init__ Function

Constractor 
-> All calsses have a function called __init__(),
-> Witch is always executed when the object is beaing initiated.

# creating class

class Student:
    def __init__(self,fullname):
        self.name = fullname

# creating object
s1 = Student("karan")

print(s1.name)

*The self parameter is a reference to the current
instance of the class, and is used to access variables
that belongs to the class

attributes => data;variables


## Class & Instance Attributes

Class.attr
obj.attr

## Methods

Methods are function that belong to objects

# Creating Class 
class Student:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

    def hello(self):
        print("Hello",self.name)

# Creating Object

s1 = Student("Karan")
s1.hello()

## Static Methods

class student:
    @staticmethod
    def collage:
        print("ABC collage")

* Decorators allows us to wrap another function in order to 
extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without
permanently modifying it
  

## Important
Abstraction
-> Hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the essential features to the user.


Encapsulation
-> Wrapping data and function into a singal unit (object).


## del keyword 
-> Used to delete object properties or object itself.

del s1.name
del s1

## Private(like) Attributes and Methods

Conceptual implementation in Python

-> Private attributes & methods are ment to be used only within the class and are not
accessible from outside the class.

## Inheritance

When one class (child/derived) derives the properties & methods of another class (parent/base).

class Car:
    ...

class ToyotaCar(Car):
    ...


## Types Inheritance

-> singal
-> Multi-level Inheritance
-> Multiple Inheritance

## Super Methods

-> Super() Method is used to access methods of the parent class.

## class method

-> A class method is bound to the class & recives the class as an implicit first argument.
-> Note - static method can't access or modify class state & generally for utility.

class Student:
    @classmethod #decorator
    def collage(cls):
        pass


## Property 
-> We use @property decorator on any method in the class to use the method as a property.


## Polymorphism : Operator Overloading

-> When the same operator is allowed to have different meaning according to the context.

Operators & Dunder function

a + b # addition a.__add__(b)
a - b # substration a.__sub__(b)
a * b # multification a.__mul____(b)
a / b # Division a.__truediv____(b)
a % b # addition a.__mod____(b)
