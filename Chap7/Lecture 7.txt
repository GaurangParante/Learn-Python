File I/O in Python

Python can be used to perform operations on a file. (Read and Write data)

Types of file:
1) Text files: .txt , .docx, .log, etc.
2) Binary files: .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg, etc.

Open, Read & Close File
we have to open a file before reading or writing.

f = open("file_name","mode")

data = f.read()
f.close()

Character and meaning
r : open for reading (default)
w : open for writing, truncating the file first
x : create a new file and open it for writing
a : open for writing, appending to end of the file if it exist
b : binary mode
t : text mode (default)
+ : open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
r+ : read overwrite pointer at starting no truncate
w+ : read overwrite truncate
a+ : read append pointer at ending no truncate

Reading File
data = f.read() -> Read entire file
data = f.readline() -> reads one line at a time 



Deleting File

using the os module

Module (like a code library) is file written by another programmer that generally has 
a function we can use

import os

os.remove(filename)
